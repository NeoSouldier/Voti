# Voti
Blockchain Hackathon London January '18 - A simple voting system built for the developing world making use of Yoti for ID and a decentralised architecture

## The Problem
- In a world full of “fake news” and lack of trust in the government - we’ve tackled the problem of petitions, as they are easy to game with bots and corrupt authorities
- In emerging economies it can be difficult to get accurate results for local elections due to lack of infrastructure

## The Solution
- Accessible, transparent and anonymous petition system 
- Strong guarantee that cannot be gamed due to blockchain immutability and transparency
